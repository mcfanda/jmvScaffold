# Introduction {#booklet}

## Preface 

`r draft`

Here you can find a how-to to build a `r jamovi` package using the R package [jmvScaffold](https://github.com/mcfanda/jmvScaffold), which provides several functions and [R6 classes](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html) to ease the development of 
`r jamovi` modules. Much of the [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org) module development information
can be found in the [jamovi developer's hub](https://dev.jamovi.org/).

Reference and detailed functions description of the package can be found in [jmvScaffold reference page](reference/index.html).


We should note that developing a `r jamovi` module does not require any of this material. This material, furthermore, will
not make your coding easier than just using `r jamovi` functions as described in [jamovi developer's hub](https://dev.jamovi.org/). However, when your module starts to get a bit complicated, offering several analyses and sub-modules, or when you want your module to do more sophisticate actions, or more refined style, this material may come handy. 

This documentation assumes that the reader is familiar with the basic of jamovi module development, but one may get away without that, and be able to develop a `r jamovi` module only reading these pages.

To program a jamovi module, you want to have a basic knowledge of [R6 classes](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html). You do not need much, as it is very easy to work with them. R6 classes bring object-oriented programming to R. R6 objects are basically functions that know themselves.

A final word to end the preface: Here we assume that we want to build a jamovi module, store it to `r ext_url("github","https://github.com")`, and then publish it in the `r jamovi` library. If you do not have the second or the third aim (you may want to build a module only for yourself), you can skip the parts related with them.

## Getting Started {#getstarted}

First, you need to get ready for developing a module, so you want to consult [jamovi developer's hub getting started section](https://dev.jamovi.org/tuts0101-getting-started.html). In a nutshell, you need:

* To install `r jamovi` 

* To install `jmvtools` R package, provided by the jamovi core developing group.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('jmvtools', repos=c('https://repo.jamovi.org', 'https://cran.r-project.org'))
```

* To install `jmvScaffold` R package (check out if you need some dependency)

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mcfanda/jmvScaffold")

```

We will see that your module will not need to install `jmvScaffold` to work, you just need it to program. Thus, **when you publish your module, `r jamovi` will not need to install `jmvScaffold` package**. The necessary files to take advantage of the functions and classes provided by `jmvScaffold` will be part of your module, independently of `jmvScaffold` package. Thus, no change or update for `jmvScaffold` will affect your code in the future, nor any link to the package will bind your code to it. 

## Create a module {#createmodule}

A module in `r jamovi` is a R package that works also in jamovi. As such, it needs to have all the characteristics
of a R package, plus the additional information and coding required to interface the R package to `r jamovi`. Thus,
to obtain a working module we need to make steps both for the R package and for the jamovi interface.

We now create a new module, named `COOLj`. At the end of this material, the `COOLj` module will `r ext_url("look like this", "https://github.com/mcfanda/COOLj")`. For simplicity, we aim at producing a module that does a linear regression and some other simple statistics.

First, we create its folder (so be sure you are in a parent folder) and the folders structure with `jmvtool`


```{r eval=FALSE}
jmvtools::create('COOLj')

```

This should produce, in the `COOLj` folder, this structure.

`r knitr::include_graphics("pics/c1_create_folders.png")`

If you use [RStudio](https://posit.co/), it is a good idea to create a project in the `COOLj` folder, because working with
RStudio projects make our lives much easier.


We now need to fill the `DESCRIPTION` file as for any R package. Here an example

```{r eval=FALSE}
Package: COOLj
Type: Package
Title: Simple example of jmvScaffold
Version: 0.0.1
Author: mcfanda
Maintainer: Mcfanda <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: This is an example of
    jmvScaffold
License: GPL
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
Imports: jmvcore (>= 0.8.5), R6
```

This describes your package in R. Now we need to define a description for `r jamovi`, filling the file
`./jamovi/0000.yaml`

```{yaml}
title: Simple example of jmvScaffold
name: COOLj
version: 0.0.1
jms: '1.0'
authors:
  - Mcfanda
maintainer: mcfanda <yourself@somewhere.net>
date: '2023-1-1'
type: R
description: >-
      This is an example of jmvScaffold
analyses: []
usesNative: true
minApp: 1.0.8

```

We will get back to this file later on. For now, we happy.

Finally, we copy the `jmvScaffold` classes in our module `./R` folder with

```{r eval=FALSE}

jmvScaffold::copy_files()

```


## Defining the analysis

A module can do several things, but at least it should execute one analysis. By `analysis` I mean a set of stats
that would produce some results, such as t-test, a correlation, a machine learning classification algorithm, a Bayesian supercool test equivalent to the t-test . 
In this example we want to develop a module that deal with linear models. We start simply, and aim at producing a linear regression. 
We make it more complex later on. This model will be useless, because `r jamovi` already comes with a nice command for regression, `Regression->Linear Regression`, or one can install  [GAMLj module](https://gamlj.github.io/) for regressions and many other linear models. Here we set this aim for demonstrative purposes.


## jamovi analysis

We want to call this `analysis` `myRegression`. so, we create a file named `myRegression` in the `./jamovi/` folder.

```{r eval=FALSE}
jmvtools::addAnalysis(name='myRegression', title='Regression analysis')

```

The  option `name` decides the name of the R function that will be produced, and the option `title` decides how
the function will be labelled in the `r jamovi` menu (it can be changed later on if needed).

Running the command produces several files. In the `./jamovi/` folder we have

`r knitr::include_graphics("pics/c1_jamovi_files.png")`

In them, the jamovi input and output features are defined.

* In _\*.a.yaml_ file the input options are defined, see API here `r ext_url("jamovi hub: Analysis","https://dev.jamovi.org/api_analysis-definition.html#options")`. 
* In _\*.u.yaml_ file the input layout  is of the user interface is  defined, see API here `r ext_url("jamovi hub: GUI","https://dev.jamovi.org/api_ui-definition.html")` 

* In _\*.r.yaml_ file the output results tables are defined, see API here `r ext_url("jamovi hub: Results","https://dev.jamovi.org/api_results-definition.html")` 

We should fill them all.
