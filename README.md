# jmvScaffold


This package provides a series of R6 classes and function to develop [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/) modules. 
I use it for developing my modules [GAMLj](https://github.com/gamlj/gamlj), [jAMM](https://github.com/jamm/jamm), [SEMLj](https://github.com/semlj/semlj) and [PATHj]((https://github.com/pathj/pathj) but feel free to use it as you wish.

There is a [help page](), more like a personal memo on how to use the functions, but it may help others too.
